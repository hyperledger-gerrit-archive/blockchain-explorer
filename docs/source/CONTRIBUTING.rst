Contributions Welcome!
======================

We welcome contributions to Hyperledger Explorer in many forms, and
there's always plenty to do!

First things first, please review the Hyperledger `Code of
Conduct <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct>`__
before participating. It is important that we keep things civil.

Ways to contribute
------------------
There are many ways you can contribute to Hyperledger Explorer, both as a user and
as a developer.

As a user:

- `Making Feature/Enhancement Proposals`_
- `Reporting bugs`_
- Help test
  `release roadmap <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BE>`_.
  Contact the Epic assignee via the Jira work item or on
  `RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`_.

As a developer:

- If you only have a little time, consider picking up a
  `"help-wanted" <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=BE&rapidView=157&view=planning>`_ task,
  see `Fixing issues and working stories`_.
- If you can commit to full-time development, either propose a new feature
  (see `Making Feature/Enhancement Proposals`_) and
  bring a team to implement it, or join one of the teams working on an existing Epic.
  If you see an Epic that interests you on the
  `release roadmap <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BE>`_,
  contact the Epic assignee via the Jira work item or on `RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`_.

Getting a Linux Foundation account
----------------------------------

In order to participate in the development of the Hyperledger Explorer
project, you will need a :doc:`Linux Foundation
account <Gerrit/lf-account>`. You will need to use your LF ID to
access to all the Hyperledger community tools, including
`Gerrit <https://gerrit.hyperledger.org>`__,
`Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org>`__,
`RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/>`__.

Project Governance
------------------

Hyperledger Explorer is managed under an open governance model as described in
our `charter <https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter>`__. Projects and
sub-projects are lead by a set of maintainers. New sub-projects can
designate an initial set of maintainers that will be approved by the
top-level project's existing maintainers when the project is first
approved.

Maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hyperledger Explorer project is lead by the project's top level :doc:`maintainers <MAINTAINERS>`.
The maintainers are responsible for reviewing and merging all patches submitted
for review, and they guide the overall technical direction of the project within
the guidelines established by the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

Becoming a maintainer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project's maintainers will, from time-to-time, consider
adding or removing a maintainer. An existing maintainer can submit a
change set to the :doc:`MAINTAINERS.rst <MAINTAINERS>` file. A nominated
Contributor may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of the proposal
by the existing Maintainers. Once approved, the change set is then merged
and the individual is added to (or alternatively, removed from) the maintainers
group. Maintainers may be removed by explicit resignation, for prolonged
inactivity (3 or more months), or for some infraction of the `code of conduct
<https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct>`__
or by consistently demonstrating poor judgement. A maintainer removed for
inactivity should be restored following a sustained resumption of contributions
and reviews (a month or more) demonstrating a renewed commitment to the project.


Making Feature/Enhancement Proposals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, take time to review
`JIRA <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=157&projectKey=BE&view=planning.nodetail>`__
to be sure that there isn't already an open (or recently closed) proposal for the
same function. If there isn't, to make a proposal we recommend that you open a
JIRA Epic or Story, whichever seems to best fit the circumstance and
link or inline a "one pager" of the proposal that states what the feature would
do and, if possible, how it might be implemented. It would help also to make a
case for why the feature should be added, such as identifying specific use
case(s) for which the feature is needed and a case for what the benefit would be
should the feature be implemented. Once the JIRA issue is created, and the
"one pager" either attached, inlined in the description field, or a link to a
publicly accessible document is added to the description, send an introductory
email to the explorer@lists.hyperledger.org mailing list linking the
JIRA issue, and soliciting feedback.

Discussion of the proposed feature should be conducted in the JIRA issue itself,
so that we have a consistent pattern within our community as to where to find
design discussion.

Getting the support of three or more of the Hyperledger Explorer maintainers for
the new feature will greatly enhance the probability that the feature's related
CRs will be included in a subsequent release.

Maintainers meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maintainers may hold on demand Zoom meeting, or planned SCRUM meetings, please ask in `chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__
for any questions you may have, or to schedule a meeting.

The purpose of the maintainers meeting is to plan for and review the progress of
releases, and to discuss the technical and operational direction of the project
and sub-projects.

New feature/enhancement proposals as described above should be presented to a
maintainers meeting for consideration, feedback and acceptance.


Communications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/>`__ for communication
and Zoom meetingâ„¢ for screen sharing between developers. Our
development planning and prioritization is done in
`JIRA <https://jira.hyperledger.org>`__, and we take longer running
discussions/decisions to the `mailing
list <https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer/messages>`__.

Contribution guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following are the software dependencies required to install and run Hyperledger Explorer:

- Nodejs 8.11.x (Note that v9.x is not yet supported)
- PostgreSQL 9.5 or greater
- `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq>`__
- Linux-based operating system, such as Ubuntu
- MacOS

Verified Docker versions supported:

- `Docker CE 18.09.2 or later <https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux>`__
- `Docker Compose 1.14.0 <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`__



Getting help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are looking for something to work on, or need some expert
assistance in debugging a problem or working out a fix to an issue, our
`community <https://www.hyperledger.org/community>`__ is always eager to
help. We hang out on
`Chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__, and the `mailing
lists <https://lists.hyperledger.org/>`__. Most of us don't bite :grin:
and will be glad to help. The only silly question is the one you don't
ask. Questions are in fact a great way to help improve the project as
they highlight where our documentation could be clearer.

Reporting bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a user and you have found a bug, please submit an issue using
`JIRA <https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BE/issues>`__.
Before you create a new JIRA issue, please try to search the existing items to
be sure no one else has previously reported it. If it has been previously
reported, then you might add a comment that you also are interested in seeing
the defect fixed.

.. note:: If the defect is security-related, please follow the Hyperledger
          `security bug reporting process <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Defect+Response>`__.

If it has not been previously reported, create a new JIRA. Please try to provide
sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the
issue. One of the project's maintainers should respond to your issue within 24
hours. If not, please bump the issue with a comment and request that it be
reviewed. You can also post to the relevant Hyperledger Explorer channel in
`chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__.

Submitting your fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you just submitted a JIRA for a bug you've discovered, and would like to
provide a fix, we would welcome that gladly! Please assign the JIRA issue to
yourself, then you can submit a change request (CR).

.. note:: If you need help with submitting your first CR, we have created a brief :doc:`CR <submit_cr>`.


Fixing issues and working stories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Review the `issues
list <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=155&view=planning.nodetail>`__ and find
something that interests you.
It is wise to start with something relatively straight forward and
achievable, and that no one is already assigned. If no one is assigned,
then assign the issue to yourself. Please be considerate and rescind the
assignment if you cannot finish in a reasonable time, or add a comment
saying that you are still actively working the issue if you need a
little more time.

Reviewing submitted Change Requests (CRs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to contribute and learn about Hyperledger Explorer is to help the
maintainers with the review of the CRs that are open. Indeed
maintainers have the difficult role of having to review all the CRs
that are being submitted and evaluate whether they should be merged or
not. You can review the code and/or documentation changes, test the
changes, and tell the submitters and maintainers what you think. Once
your review and/or test is complete just reply to the CR with your
findings, by adding comments and/or voting. A comment saying something
like "I tried it on system X and it works" or possibly "I got an error
on system X: xxx " will help the maintainers in their evaluation. As a
result, maintainers will be able to process CRs faster and everybody
will gain from it.

Just browse through `the open CRs on Gerrit
<https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/dashboard/self>`__ to get started.

Setting up development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, try :doc:`building the project <dev-setup/build>` in your local
development environment to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

What makes a good change request?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  One change at a time. Not five, not three, not ten. One and only one.
   Why? Because it limits the blast area of the change. If we have a
   regression, it is much easier to identify the culprit commit than if
   we have some composite change that impacts more of the code.

-  Include a link to the JIRA story for the change. Why? Because a) we
   want to track our velocity to better judge what we think we can
   deliver and when and b) because we can justify the change more
   effectively. In many cases, there should be some discussion around a
   proposed change and we want to link back to that from the change
   itself.

-  Include unit and integration tests (or changes to existing tests)
   with every change. This does not mean just happy path testing,
   either. It also means negative testing of any defensive code that it
   correctly catches input errors. When you write code, you are
   responsible to test it and provide the tests that demonstrate that
   your change does what it claims. Why? Because without this we have no
   clue whether our current code base actually works.

-  Unit tests should have NO external dependencies. You should be able
   to run unit tests in place with ``./main.sh install && ./main.sh test`` or equivalent for the
   language. Any test that requires some external dependency (e.g. needs
   to be scripted to run another component) needs appropriate mocking.
   Anything else is not unit testing, it is integration testing by
   definition. Why? Because many open source developers do Test Driven
   Development. They place a watch on the directory that invokes the
   tests automagically as the code is changed. This is far more
   efficient than having to run a whole build between code changes. See
   `this definition <http://artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test/>`__
   of unit testing for a good set of criteria to keep in mind for writing
   effective unit tests.

-  Minimize the lines of code per CR. Why? Maintainers have day jobs,
   too. If you send a 1,000 or 2,000 LOC change, how long do you think
   it takes to review all of that code? Keep your changes to < 200-300
   LOC, if possible. If you have a larger change, decompose it into
   multiple independent changes. If you are adding a bunch of new
   functions to fulfill the requirements of a new capability, add them
   separately with their tests, and then write the code that uses them
   to deliver the capability. Of course, there are always exceptions. If
   you add a small change and then add 300 LOC of tests, you will be
   forgiven;-) If you need to make a change that has broad impact or a
   bunch of generated code (protobufs, etc.). Again, there can be
   exceptions.

.. note:: Large change requests, e.g. those with more than 300 LOC are more likely
          than not going to receive a -2, and you'll be asked to refactor the
          change to conform with this guidance.

-  Do not stack change requests (e.g. submit a CR from the same local branch
   as your previous CR) unless they are related. This will minimize merge
   conflicts and allow changes to be merged more quickly. If you stack requests
   your subsequent requests may be held up because of review comments in the
   preceding requests.

-  Write a meaningful commit message. Include a meaningful 55 (or less)
   character title, followed by a blank line, followed by a more
   comprehensive description of the change. Each change MUST include the JIRA
   identifier corresponding to the change (e.g. [BE-1234]). This can be
   in the title but should also be in the body of the commit message. See the
   :doc:`complete requirements <Gerrit/changes>` for an acceptable change
   request.

.. note:: That Gerrit will automatically create a hyperlink to the JIRA item.
          e.g.

          ::

              [BE-1234] fix foobar()

              Fix [BE-1234] added a check to ensure that when foobar(foo string)
              is called, that there is a non-empty string argument.

Finally, be responsive. Don't let a change request fester with review
comments such that it gets to a point that it requires a rebase. It only
further delays getting it merged and adds more work for you - to
remediate the merge conflicts.

Legal stuff
-----------

**Note:** Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. See the template of the `license header
<https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/docs/source/headers.txt>`__.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

::

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using ``git commit -s``.
